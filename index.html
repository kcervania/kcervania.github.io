At the end of a course, each learner should feel like they can easily apply the knowledge and build habits toward better learning.</li>
                    <li>Experience: My first role as an eLearning Specialist was in Malaysia. I was an eLearning designer & also a voice talent for K-12 subjects. I then became a UX designer helping course creators use our LMS for training. Learning is such a big part of my life, an essential skill that has helped me grow my career since day 1.</li>
